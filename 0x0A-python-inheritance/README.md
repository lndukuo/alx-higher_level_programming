#Python Inheritance

## Overview

This project aims to delve into the intricacies of inheritance in Python, emphasizing the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Through a curated set of tasks, we will explore various inheritance facets such as superclass, subclass, method overriding, and more.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, we should be proficient in:

- Recognizing the pivotal role of inheritance in Python.
- Distinguishing between superclass, base class, and subclass entities.
- Overriding methods and attributes inherited from the base class.
- Leveraging built-in functions such as `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super`.
- Crafting classes with multiple base classes and adeptly handling edge cases.

## Requirements

### Development Environment

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: 3.8.5

### Supported Editors

- `vi`
- `vim`
- `emacs`

### Coding Standards

- Adhere to PEP 8 coding conventions.
- Ensure executability of all files.
- Utilize `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for code linting.

## Project Structure

The project comprises multiple tasks, each targeting a specific inheritance-related topic. Here's a succinct overview:

0. **Lookup**: Craft a function enumerating all attributes and methods of an object.
1. **MyList**: Develop a class inheriting from Python's built-in `list` class, incorporating sorting capabilities.
2. **is_same_class**: Construct a function verifying if an object corresponds to a specified class instance.
3. **is_kind_of_class**: Formulate a function discerning if an object is an instance or subclass of a designated class.
4. **inherits_from**: Engineer a function ascertaining if an object emanates from a subclass of a specific class.
5. **BaseGeometry**: Institute a base class equipped with an abstract `area()` method.
6. **Rectangle and Square**: Instantiate subclasses inheriting from `BaseGeometry` encapsulating distinct functionalities.

## Usage Guidelines

To execute individual tasks, navigate to the pertinent directory and launch the respective Python script via the command line:

```bash
python3 path_to_task_directory/task_script_name.py
