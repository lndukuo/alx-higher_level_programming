# Python Input/Output Operations Project

## Overview
This project focuses on mastering Python's input/output operations. It covers various tasks related to reading from and writing to files, working with JSON serialization and deserialization, and more.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of Python file handling.
- Learn how to read and write text files using Python.
- Gain knowledge about JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Implement Python scripts that perform various file and JSON operations.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python's input/output functionalities. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Task 0: Read File**
   - Implement a function to read a text file and print its content to stdout.

2. **Task 1: Write to a File**
   - Create a function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

3. **Task 2: Append to a File**
   - Develop a function to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.

4. **Task 3: To JSON String**
   - Write a function to convert a Python object to a JSON string representation.

5. **Task 4: From JSON String to Object**
   - Implement a function to convert a JSON string back to a Python object.

6. **Task 5: Save Object to a File**
   - Create a function to save a Python object as a JSON file.

7. **Task 6: Create Object from a JSON File**
   - Develop a function to load a Python object from a JSON file.

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts associated with these tasks, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
